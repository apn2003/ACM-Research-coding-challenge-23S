Before starting code:
Since I have moderate experience with coding in Python, it was a struggle to get started. It had also been a long time since I coded in Python, so remembering syntax details was irritating, but also satisying as the little details came back to me slowly. Having no expereince with working with files in Python, it took a lot of digging through Python documentation to figure out how to get started.

Part 1:
I took inspiration from the example questions provided to us. I iterated through the entire column which contained the star type and stored the number of each type using a dictionary. I found that there are a equal amount of stars for each star type. When finished with this task, I realized that this task was too easy and to show my ambition I need to present something more complicated. 

Part2:
Even though the second part to my code has resemeblence to the first part, I had to reseratch a lot more. The biggest aspect I struggled with the most was how to find the row number of the cell I was in. This problem had the simplest solution as I only had to keep a counter variable to keep track of the row number. The second part of my code iterates through the star type column and keeps track of the spectral classes for different star types. I created arrays for each star type which held the spectral class for each star in that star type. From there, I figured out what was the most common spectral class for each star type and printed the results for the user.
